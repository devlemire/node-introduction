# Project Summary

In this project, we will create a node server that will act as a Bookshelf. This server will keep track of Books by being able to add books to a collect, remove from the collection, delete from the collection, and read from the collection. We'll use postman to test our endpoints.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we will create a package.json to keep track of our server's packages.

### Instructions

* Run `npm init -y`.

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we will install the most common packages you'll use when making a node server.

### Instructions

* Run `npm install --save express body-parser`

## Step 3

In this step, we will create a `.gitignore` file to ignore the `node_modules` folder `npm install` created.

### Instructions

* Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the project.
* Add `node_modules` on the first line and save the file.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> .gitignore </code> </summary>

```
node_modules
```

</details>

## Step 4

In this step, we will create our server and have it listen on port `3005`.

### Instructions

* Create an `index.js` file in `server/`.
* Open `server/index.js`.
* Require `express` and `body-parser`.
* Create a variable called `app` that equals `express` invoked. 
* Call the `listen` method on app. The app should listen on port 3005:
  * The first parameter of `listen` is the port number.
  * The second parameter of `listen` is a function that is called when the app starts listening.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();

const port = 3005;
app.listen( port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); } );
```

</details>

## Step 5

In this step, we will create a javascript file that will keep track of our book collection.

### Instructions

* Create a folder in `server/` called `models`.
* Inside of `server/models/` create a JS file called `books_model.js`.
* Inside of `server/modles/books_model.js` use `module.exports` to export an empty array.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/models/books_model.js </code> </summary>

```js
module.exports = [];
```

</details>


## Step 6

### Summary 

In this step, we will create a javascript file that will handle all the logic of reading, creating, updating, and deleting books from the collection.

### Instructions

* Create a folder in `server/` called `controllers`.
* Inside of `server/controllers/` create a JS file called `books_controller.js`.
* Open `server/controllers/books_controller.js`.
* Import `books_model.js` at the top of the file.
* Use `module.exports` to export an empty object.
  * We'll put methods on this object later.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/controllers/books_controller.js </code> </summary>

```js
const books = require(__dirname + "/../models/books_model.js");

module.exports = {};
```

</details>

## Step 7

### Summary

In this step, we will create a javascript file that will handle the routing of our server.

### Instructions

* Create a folder in `server/` called `routes`.
* Inside of `server/routes` create a JS file called `books_router.js`.
* Open `server/routes/books_router.js`.
* At the top of the file, require `express` and the books_controller.
* Create a router by invoking the `Router` method on express.
* Use `module.exports` to export the router.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/routes/books_router.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bc = require(__dirname + '/../controllers/books_controller.js');
const router = express.Router();

module.exports = router;
```

</details>

## Step 8

### Summary

In this step, we will import our router into `server/index.js` and run our server to make sure everything has been setup correctly.

### Instructions

* Import the books router from `server/routes/books_router.js`.
* Start the api by running `node index.js` or `nodemon` ( make sure your terminal is in the server directory ).

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();

const router = require('./routes/books_router');

const port = 3005;
app.listen( port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); } );
```
