# Project Summary

In this project, we will create a node server that will act as a Bookshelf. This server will keep track of Books by being able to add books to a collect, remove from the collection, delete from the collection, and read from the collection. We'll use postman to test our endpoints.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we will create a package.json to keep track of our server's packages.

### Instructions

* Run `npm init -y`.

### Solution

<b>insert giphy here</b>

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we will install the most common packages you'll use when making a node server.

### Instructions

* Run `npm install --save express body-parser`

### Solution

<b> insert giphy here </b>

## Step 3

In this step, we will create a `.gitignore` file to ignore the `node_modules` folder `npm install` created.

### Instructions

* Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the project.
* Add `node_modules` on the first line and save the file.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> .gitignore </code> </summary>

```
node_modules
```

</details>

## Step 4

In this step, we will create our server and have it listen on port `3005`.

## Step 4

### Instructions

* Create an `index.js` file in `server/`.
* Open `server/index.js`.
* Require `express` and `body-parser`.
* Create a variable called `App` that equals `express` invoked. 
* Call the `listen` method on App. The app should listen on port 3005:
  * The first parameter of `listen` is the port number.
  * The second parameter of `listen` is a function that is called when the App starts listening.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const App = express();

const port = 3005;
App.listen( port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); } );
```
