# Project Summary

In this project, we will create a node server that will act as a bookshelf. This server will keep track of books by being able to add books to a collect, read from the collection, update the collection, and delete from the collection. We'll use postman to test our endpoints.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we will create a package.json to keep track of our server's packages.

### Instructions

* Run `npm init -y`.

### Solution

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we will install the most common packages you'll use when making a node server.

### Instructions

* Run `npm install --save express body-parser`

### Solution

## Step 3

In this step, we will create a `.gitignore` file to ignore the `node_modules` folder `npm install` created.

### Instructions

* Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the project.
* Add `node_modules` on the first line and save the file.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> .gitignore </code> </summary>

```
node_modules
```

</details>

## Step 4

In this step, we will create our server and have it listen on port `3000`.

### Instructions

* Create an `index.js` file in `server/`.
* Open `server/index.js`.
* Require `express` in a variable called `express` and require `body-parser` in a variable called `bodyParser`.
* Create a variable called `app` that equals `express` invoked. 
* Call the `use` method on app and pass in `bodyParser`'s `json` method invoked.
* Call the `listen` method on app. The app should listen on port 3005:
  * The first parameter of `listen` is the port number.
  * The second parameter of `listen` is a function that is called when the app starts listening.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();

app.use( bodyParser.json() );

const port = 3005;
app.listen( port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); } );
```

</details>

## Step 5

### Summary

In this step, we will create a controller that keeps track of the book collection and has methods that can create books, read books, update books, and delete books.

### Instructions

* Create a folder in `server/` called `controllers`.
* In `server/controllers/` create a file called `books_controller.js`.
* Open `server/controllers/books_controller.js`.
* Create a variable called `books` that equals an empty array.
  * A book will be an object that has an `id`, `title`, and `author` property.
* Create a variable called `id` that equals `0`.
  * After a creation of a book, we will increment this by `1` to insure no books have the same `id`.
* Use `module.exports` to export an object.
* On the object created a method called `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`.
  * Create - This method should be able to add a new book to the collection using the `request body`.
  * Read - This method should return all books in the collection.
  * Update - This method should be able to update a book by an id from the `request query parameters`.
  * Delete - This method should be able to delete a book by an id from the `request query parameters`.
* All methods should return the entire books array.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/controller/books_controller.js </code> </summary>

```js
let books = [];
let id = 0;

module.exports = {
  create: ( req, res ) => {
    const { title, author } = req.body;
    books.push( { id, title, author } );
    id++;
    res.status(200).send( books );
  },

  read: ( req, res ) => {
    res.status(200).send( books );
  },

  update: ( req, res ) => {
    const updateID = req.params.id;
    let index = books.findIndex( book => book.id == updateID );

    books[ index ] = {
      id: books[ index ].id,
      title: req.body.title || books[ index ].title,
      author: req.body.author || books[ index ].author
    };

    res.status(200).send( books );
  },

  delete: ( req, res ) => {
    const deleteID = req.params.id;
    books = books.filter( book => book.id != deleteID );
    res.status(200).send( books );
  }
};
```

## Step 6

### Summary

In this step, we will import our controller into `server/index.js` and create a routes that use the methods on the controller.

When creating a route you can use the `post`, `get`, `put`, and `delete` methods on app. The first argument is the URL of the request and the second argument is what function to execute when that URL is hit.

### Instructions

* Open `server/index.js`.
* Require the books controller under the router.
* Above `port` create four routes on `app`:
  * `post` - `/api/books`, `bc.create`.
  * `get` - `/api/books`, `bc.read`.
  * `put` - `/api/books/:id`, `bc.update`.
  * `delete` - `/api/books/:id`, `bc.delete`

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const bc = require(__dirname + '/controllers/books_controller.js');

const app = express();

app.use( bodyParser.json() );

const baseURL = "/api/books";
app.post(baseURL, bc.create);
app.get(baseURL, bc.read);
app.put(`${baseURL}/:id`, bc.update);
app.delete(`${baseURL}/:id`, bc.delete);

const port = 3005;
app.listen( port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); } );
```

</details>

## Step 7

### Summary

In this step, we will use postman to test our endpoints

### Instructions

* Create three books.
* Get all books.
* Update a book.
* Delete a book.

### Solution

## Step 8

### Summary

In this step, we will use `express.static` to serve up our `index.html` file. `express.static` takes one argument that is the folder you want to server when the server URL is hit. Our front-end was made using `create-react-app` which has a production ready build. We'll want to server the entire `public/build` folder.

### Instructions

* Call the `use` method on app and pass in `express.static( __dirname + '/../public/build')`.
* Open up `http://localhost:3005/` in your browser.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const bc = require( __dirname + '/controllers/books_controller');

const app = express();

app.use( bodyParser.json() );
app.use( express.static( __dirname + "/../public/build") );

const baseURL = "/api/books";
app.post(baseURL, bc.create);
app.get(baseURL, bc.read);
app.put(`${baseURL}/:id`, bc.update);
app.delete(`${baseURL}/:id`, bc.delete);

const port = 3000;
app.listen( port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); } );
```
